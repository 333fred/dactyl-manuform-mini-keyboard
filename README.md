# The Dactyl-ManuForm-Mini Keyboard

This is a fork of the [Dactyl-Manuform](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard).

## Getting the case files and bottom plate

### Option 1: Generate OpenSCAD and STL models

* Run `lein generate` or `lein auto generate`
* This will regenerate the `things/*.scad` files
* Use OpenSCAD to open a `.scad` file.
* Make changes to design, repeat `load-file`, OpenSCAD will watch for changes and rerender.
* When done, use OpenSCAD to export STL files

### Option 2: Download from Releases

Generated models (only 4x5) can be downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/l4u/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard/releases).
