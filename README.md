This is a fork of the [Dactyl-Manuform](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard).

## Generating OpenSCAD and STL models

* Run `lein generate` or `lein auto generate`
* This will regenerate the `things/*.scad` files
* Use OpenSCAD to open a `.scad` file.
* Make changes to design, repeat `load-file`, OpenSCAD will watch for changes and rerender.
* When done, use OpenSCAD to export STL files
